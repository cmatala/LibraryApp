# Library App

This is a simple library application where users can keep track of their book collection. Users can add new books, display existing ones, remove books, and toggle their read status.

## Features

- **Add New Books**: Users can add new books to their library by providing details such as title, author, number of pages, and whether the book has been read or not.
- **Display Books**: All added books are displayed individually on their own card within the library.
- **Remove Books**: Users can remove books from their library.
- **Toggle Read Status**: Users can change the read status of each book with a toggle button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For structuring the web page content.
- CSS: For styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: For implementing the application logic.
- Dialog Element: Used for displaying the form to add new books.
- Local Storage (not implemented): Future enhancement can include storing the library data in the browser's local storage to persist the data even after page refresh.
